#IGO / English version

IGO (for Open GIS Infrastructure) is a Free Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G)  developed by organisations in the government of Quebec in Canada. The objective is to make it more open, common, modular, based on open governance model supported by multiple organisations. IGO is a Web GIS software with a client & server component to manage and publish massive amount of Geospatial data.

Since this project is open source, anyone can contribute as long as they share their work on the same open source [LGPL compatible licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infra-geo-ouverte/igo/master/LICENSE_ENGLISH.txt). All contributors in IGO keep their property rights.

IGO support many Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards (ex. : WMS, WFS, WPS) and is based on many open source software (ex. : [OpenLayers 2](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers), [ExtJS](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/3.4.0/), [GeoExt](http://geoext.org/downloads.html),  [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and [UMN MapServer](https://github.com/mapserver/mapserver), MapCache, Phalcon, Jquery, Zoo project, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Apache, Ubuntu). The source code of IGO is on [GitHub](https://github.com/infra-geo-ouverte/igo) and released under a [LGPL compatible licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infra-geo-ouverte/igo/master/LICENSE_ENGLISH.txt) (written by the government of Quebec). IGO is looking for involvement from other public administrations (local, regional and national), private enterprises, developers in Canada or elsewhere to contribute to the project.

IGO has multiple features supported and in development phase: 

- Web GIS viewer
- Location, metadata and routing integration service
- Spatial query
- Geospatial data editing
- Permission management and administration user interface
- Real-time Web Map Conferencing and chat


This project will enable anyone to configure by a simple XML its own web map application including Base Map and WMS/WFS/GeoJSON overlays in a layer tree and adding different built-in functionalities (ex. adding WMS server on-demand, share permalink, location tool) to the apps without any lines of javascript.
